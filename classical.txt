RSA strength depends on the difficulty to find prime factors of large integers and this is why these kind of algorithms gain a lot of attention.
Take an RSA key of 512 bits [ RSA-512 ]â€¦.

The GNFS (Generalize Number Field Sieve) algorithm needed 2 months and 10 days to be completed:

    2 months for the sieving part on 300 PC 400 MHz with 64Mb di RAM ( for an equivalent of 8000
    MIPS-Year )
    10 days on a Cray C90 to compute the matrix

Having t = ( time to compute 2^512 )
A simple calculus shows that we neeed:

    LOG(2^576) / LOG(2^512) = 10.9 -> 10.9 * t for a 576 bits RSA key
    LOG(2^1024) / LOG(2^512) = 7 * 10^6 * t for a 1024 bits RSA key
    LOG(2^2048) / LOG(2^512) = 9 * 10^15 * t for a 2048 bits RSA key

As we can see from this results, time required for a 2048 bits key is near the eternity;
even if we have 10^6 computers time required to compute a 2048 bits key is 9 * 10^9 bigger
than time required for a 512 bits keyâ€¦ so it is out of our possibilities.

Note that the best algorithm for integer factorization is NFS ( Number Field Sieve ).

Now weâ€™ll take a look to the classical ( and slowest ) method for integers factorization to understand the complexity of this problem.

Classical method algorithm

    N >= 2
    S = square root of N ( we take only the integer part )
    Divide N / K (with K odd , K > 1 and K < S)
        If K is a divisor of N we have found a prime factor of N and then N = N / K Restart from 2.

Classical method implementation

The following program need GMP (GNU Multi Precision) library
Compile: gcc classical.c -o classical -lgmp
Classical factoring algorithm source code
